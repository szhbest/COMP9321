# Tutorial about week4:

This lab will mainly introduce how to visualize dataset. For both df.DataFrame or df.Series, we can use **plot method** to get various types of charts, as well as to show them with the support of **matplotlib library**.<br>
First, here is an example of how to plot [**pie chart**](https://github.com/szhbest/COMP9321/blob/master/Week4%20Data%20Visualization/pie_chart.py)<br>
Next, it is about [**bar chart**](https://github.com/szhbest/COMP9321/blob/master/Week4%20Data%20Visualization/bar_chart.py)<br>
Finally, the [**scatter figure**](https://github.com/szhbest/COMP9321/blob/master/Week4%20Data%20Visualization/scatter_chart.py)<br>

All the achievements of above codes can be referred to the tutorial of **pandas libray**, click [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/series.html)<br>

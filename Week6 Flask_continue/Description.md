# Tutorial about week6:

In this lab, we will extend the py file that we produced in week5, and add a new class as well as implement some new methods in this class.<br>

**The first method is to Get a list of all books**<br>
>[In this task, we will use **Request Parsing** to pass the column names and order type.](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parsing.html)<br>

**The second method is to Add a new book**<br>
>In this task, we will define a "post" method and its implementation is similar to week5's "put" method.<br>

**Finally, we will improve Swagger Documentation manually by using:<br>
>@api.response<br>
@api.doc<br>
@api.description<br>

[Here is the sample code]

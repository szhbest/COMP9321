# Tutorial about week2:

This lab we will introduce some simple examples of regression and clustering.<br>

The first is to build a **weight prediction LinearRegression model** based on diet and person information. [Here is the code](https://github.com/szhbest/COMP9321/blob/master/Week9%20Regression%26Clustering/1.py)<br>

The second is to use **K-Means** split the iris dataset into 3 clusters, and label each data point with the true label of flower class. [Here is the code](https://github.com/szhbest/COMP9321/blob/master/Week9%20Regression%26Clustering/2.py)<br>

The third is to use **AgglomerativeClustering** split the diet dataset into 3 clusters based on the diet types, and label each data point with the true label of diet. [Here is the code](https://github.com/szhbest/COMP9321/blob/master/Week9%20Regression%26Clustering/3.py)
